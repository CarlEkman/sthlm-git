# sthlm-git
A map of the Stockholm metro stations using Git branches ðŸš‰

### How to view
Either browse the map here on GitHub from `Insights` â†’ `Network`, or in your terminal by pasting this:
```
git clone git@github.com:CarlEkman/sthlm-git.git
cd sthlm-git
git fetch --all
git log --graph --all --decorate --oneline
```

### Why?
I don't know. I wondered if anyone had done something like this and stumbled on `vbarbaresi/MetroGit`, which seemed cool.
